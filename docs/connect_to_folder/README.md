# Connecting to a live SLP folder

> **Disclaimer**: This feature does NOT work with Slippi Online! This is because while Slippi Online can handle rollbacks, it is not possible for Project Clippi to rollback firing an event. This only works with legacy versions of Slippi Dolphin.

If you are playing on Slippi Dolphin, you won't have a relay port you can connect to. Instead you will need to know the location where your SLP files are stored.

## 1. Find the Folder to track SLP files

For Windows users using Slippi Dolphin, your SLP files are typically stored in a `Slippi` folder in the same location where your `Dolphin.exe` is.

## 2. Setup Project Clippi

Make sure you have the latest version of Project Clippi from [the releases page](https://github.com/vinceau/project-clippi/releases).

Open up the settings page and click "Slippi Connection".

In the right hand panel, where it says "Monitor for SLP file changes", click "Choose", and select the `Slippi` folder location. Click "Connect".

It should now say "Connected" and display the folder underneath.

## 3. Success!

You should now be ready to start customising different events and actions. Close the settings page and start automating!
